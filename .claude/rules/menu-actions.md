## Menu bar and actions

- User actions live in `AppActions` (app target, `@MainActor`), shared by the toolbar/bottom-bar buttons
  (`WindowContentView`), the menu bar (`agtermApp`'s `.commands`), and the control channel (`ControlServer`)
  so the three never drift.
  Trivial one-liners (quick-terminal toggle) call the controller/store directly;
  `AppActions` owns the ones with real logic — new-session placement, the directory picker,
  split + focus, and font.
- **Menu split: View vs Navigate.**
  The menu bar has TWO custom menus (besides File/Help).
  **View** (`CommandGroup(after: .toolbar)`) holds appearance + what-is-shown:
  font/theme, sidebar show-hide + expand/collapse, the flagged-view + Flag/Clear-Flagged + Focus Workspace
  items, and the surface toggles (Split/Scratch/Find/Quick Terminal).
  **Navigate** (a separate top-level `CommandMenu("Navigate")`, placed right after the View group so
  AppKit renders it after View) holds moving the selection/focus: the two palettes (Go to Session / Command
  Palette), session stepping (Previous/Next, Previous/Next Attention, First/Last),
  and Focus Left/Right Pane.
  This is a pure menu-PLACEMENT split — every item still drives the SAME `AppActions`,
  and the control/palette/keymap surfaces are untouched (so it is NOT a keep-in-sync change).
  When adding a menu item, file it by intent: display state → View, moving between things → Navigate.
  XCUITest helpers that open a menu by title must target the menu the item actually lives in (the `PaletteUITests`/`KeymapUITests`
  `openPalette` helpers open **Navigate** for the palette items).
- **Keep-in-sync convention (HARD).**
  Any new user action added to `AppActions`/`AppStore` is not "done" until it is also drivable from the
  control socket.
  Shipping a new action requires all four of: (1) a `Command` case (plus any args) in `agtermCore`'s
  control protocol, (2) a dispatch arm in `ControlServer`, (3) an `agtermctl` subcommand,
  (4) protocol round-trip plus end-to-end tests for it.
  This extends the toolbar/menu-bar "never drift" rule to the third surface — the control channel.
  See the Control API section below.
- Font menu items (⌘+/⌘−/⌘0) drive libghostty on the *focused* surface via `GhosttySurfaceView.performBindingAction("increase_font_size:1"/"decrease_font_size:1"/"reset_font_size")`.
  `focusedSurface()` is the key window's first responder (main pane, split pane,
  or quick terminal), else the active session's surface.
  A menu-driven font change still rides the CELL_SIZE → persist path, like the keybind.
- **In-terminal search (⌘F).**
  `BuiltinAction.toggleSearch` (`defaultChord` = ⌘F, expressible/rebindable — NOT one of the arrow-bound
  exceptions) drives `AppActions.toggleSearch()` → `focusedSurface().startSearch()` (the `start_search`
  binding action).
  It is a real View ▸ Find… menu item (reading `equivalent(for: .toggleSearch)`,
  no hardcoded shortcut) plus a ⌃⇧P palette "Find…" entry. libghostty replies with a `START_SEARCH` action;
  the surface's `onSearchStart` closure TOGGLES — if the owning session's bar is already visible it calls
  `endSearch()` (sends `end_search`, so libghostty actually exits search mode,
  never just flips the flag), else opens the bar (`searchActive = true`,
  seeds any returned needle) and focuses the field.
  The `onSearchEnd` closure clears the four search fields and returns first responder to the terminal
  (`focusAfterReparent`); `onSearchTotal`/`onSearchSelected` set `searchTotal`/`searchSelected` (negative
  `ssize_t` → nil).
  The four `GhosttySurfaceView` methods (`startSearch`/`sendSearchQuery`/`navigateSearch`/`endSearch`)
  are thin wrappers over `performBindingAction`, the four callbacks are wired by ALL THREE in-tree surface
  factories — `makeSurface`/`makeSplitSurface`/`makeScratchSurface` via the shared `wireSearchCallbacks`
  helper (the `splitFocused` direct-write precedent) — and the four `GHOSTTY_ACTION_START_SEARCH`/`END_SEARCH`/`SEARCH_TOTAL`/`SEARCH_SELECTED`
  arms in `GhosttyCallbacks.action` copy the needle to a `String` before the main hop and return `true`.
  `AppActions` also owns `updateSearchNeedle(_:)`/`navigateSearch(_:)`/`endSearch()` for the bar.
  The state is the four ephemeral `Session` fields + `searchDisplayText` (the "N of M" / "M matches"
  / "no matches" computed), shared with the `session.search` control half (see the Control API catalog)
  so the GUI and control surfaces can't drift.
  **The SCRATCH terminal is searchable (the quick terminal + full overlay are NOT).** Wiring `makeScratchSurface`
  makes the scratch `isSearchable`, so ⌘F over a shown scratch opens the bar on the scratch itself:
  `coverHidesActiveSession` (the ⌘F open gate) blocks only the quick terminal + a FULL overlay (both
  unsearchable, focus-stealing over a hidden pane) — NOT the scratch; and `searchTarget()` checks the
  scratch-covers case FIRST (returns `topmostSurface` = the scratch when `scratchActive && !overlayActive`,
  BEFORE consulting `focusedSurface()`), so a ⌘F while the scratch covers the session never opens on
  the pane underneath — even when key-window focus sits off the surface (e.g. the sidebar),
  where `focusedSurface()` would otherwise fall back to the hidden `activeSurface`.
  A FLOATING overlay leaves the pane visible, so search there still targets the pane behind it (not the
  unsearchable overlay surface).
  Teardown: `AppStore.closeScratch` (the scratch shell's `exit`) clears search via `session.clearSearch()`
  ONLY when the bar is pinned to the scratch being torn down (`searchSurface === scratchSurface`) — so
  a search owned by the main/split pane survives the scratch teardown — mirroring the closeSplit/closePrimaryPane
  clear; the full session/workspace/window teardowns destroy the session entirely so no surviving bar
  can stick.
- **Split panes (one session, two shells).**
  Three observed flags on `Session`: `isSplit` = the split is shown side-by-side;
  `hasSplit` = the session HAS a split pane at all (stays true while hidden,
  cleared only by `closeSplit`); `splitFocused` = which pane holds focus.
  The split (right) surface is wired to the session as `isSplitPane`, so its PWD/title go to `splitCwd`/`splitTitle`,
  and the focus-aware `Session.displayName`/`focusedCwd` make the sidebar row AND the title bar track
  whichever pane is focused — guarded on `splitFocused` alone (NOT `isSplit`),
  so it follows a hidden-but-focused split pane.
  `effectiveCwd` stays the PRIMARY pane's (non-focus-aware) for seeding new panes + the `AGTERM_SESSION_PWD`
  token; `Session.activeSurface` is the focused pane's surface (the focus helpers + the collapsed detail
  pane target it).
  **Opening a split moves focus to the new (right) pane** (`AppStore.toggleSplit` sets `splitFocused = true`
  on open; hiding leaves it set so the focused pane is the one shown maximized).
  **Hiding the split (the toolbar toggle) keeps BOTH shells alive** and shows the focused pane maximized
  — `detailPane`'s collapsed branch renders `\.splitSurface` when `splitFocused`,
  else `\.surface` — so reopening restores the two panes in place; nothing is destroyed (`closeSplit`
  only runs when the split shell exits).
  **Exiting a pane's shell keeps the session, collapsed to the survivor:** the primary's `onExit` is
  `AppStore.closePrimaryPane` (promotes the split pane to a single non-split session,
  its cwd promoted to the session's) and the split's is `closeSplitPane` (collapses to the primary,
  or closes the session if the primary already exited).
  Only a single (non-split) session's exit closes it.
  The collapse re-hosts the survivor (HSplitView → standalone), which drops focus,
  so `GhosttySurfaceView.focusAfterReparent` re-grabs first responder until it sticks past the re-host.
  `⌘⌥←`/`⌘⌥→` (+ the "Focus Left/Right Pane" menu items and palette entries,
  + `session.focus`) move focus via `AppActions.focusPane(_:)`/`setSplitFocus(_:of:)` — ALL gated on
  `hasSplit`, NOT `isSplit` (the menu items' `.disabled`, the palette gate,
  the `setSplitFocus` guard, `revealSession`, and the `session.focus` control arm),
  so pane navigation works whether the split is shown side-by-side OR hidden (maximized).
  When hidden, focusing the other pane just flips `splitFocused`, which swaps which pane the collapsed
  `detailPane` shows maximized (the "switch the zoomed pane with the other" behavior);
  the single-pane (no-split) state still disables/no-ops them.
  `⌃1`/`⌃2` are a direct-switch alias for the same `focusPane(.main)`/`focusPane(.split)` actions,
  caught by `PaneShortcuts` (an app-wide `NSEvent` local monitor, like the Ctrl-Tab switcher — NOT a
  SwiftUI shortcut, so they aren't duplicate menu items).
  The monitor ALWAYS consumes `⌃1`/`⌃2` (reserved app shortcuts) so they never leak to the shell — on
  a non-split session `focusPane` is a no-op rather than the terminal printing a literal "1" (the bug
  from the first cut, which only consumed when split).
  No new control command — `session.focus` already covers it.
  Each pane persists its OWN cwd: `SessionSnapshot.splitCwd` + `Session.initialSplitCwd` seed the split
  shell on restore.
  The split's DIVIDER RATIO persists per-session too: `SessionSnapshot.splitRatio` (a 0...1 left-pane
  fraction) is captured by `SplitRatioAccessor` (`agterm/Views/SplitRatioAccessor.swift`) — a `.background` `NSViewRepresentable`
  on the PRIMARY pane (a background, not a third arranged pane; unconditional so it never perturbs the
  split shape) that introspects the AppKit `NSSplitView` under the SwiftUI `HSplitView`,
  since no SwiftUI API exposes the divider position.
  It `setPosition`s the divider once the split has a real width (retried per `layout()` pass) and writes
  the current fraction back to `Session.splitRatio` (`@ObservationIgnored`) on each `NSSplitView.didResizeSubviewsNotification`.
  Persisted by a debounced `save()` ~0.4 s after the drag settles (coalescing one drag's resize ticks
  via a cancel-and-reschedule `DispatchWorkItem`), plus the usual save points and the quit-flush,
  so a force-quit keeps it too, symmetric with the sidebar WIDTH (which saves on the drag's `.onEnded`).
  **`SplitRatioAccessor` ALSO clips the split's divider out of the titlebar strip (`updateDividerClip`).**
  In COMPACT mode (`titlebarHeight` = 30) the SwiftUI `.padding(.top, titlebarHeight)` lands inside the
  window's safe-area band, so the AppKit `NSSplitView` IGNORES it and grows to the FULL window height
  (verified: its frame + both arranged panes span pt 0..windowHeight; the 48px non-compact inset clears
  the band so normal mode is already bounded).
  The panes' top strip is then empty terminal-bg (invisible against the window bg),
  but the divider draws BLACK through it — a streak up through the transparent titlebar (only the DIVIDER
  shows; the panes' content still starts at the content top because the terminal grid respects the safe
  area).
  The fix is a **CALayer mask on the `NSSplitView`** hiding its overrun strip — the overrun is computed
  LIVE (`titlebarHeight - splitTopFromContentTop`, ~30 in compact, 0 in normal → mask dropped) so normal
  mode is untouched and the clip tracks window resize.
  Use a layer mask, NOT SwiftUI `.mask`/`.clipped()`: those reflow the terminal grid (scroll the top
  row away — confirmed twice), while a layer mask is render-only; and NOT an opaque cover (would break
  translucency — the mask reveals the window backing).
  The detail `HSplitView` carries `.id("<session>-hsplit")` so its `NSSplitView`/divider can't leak across
  session switches.
  A session with a split shows a split-rectangle icon in the sidebar (`WorkspaceSidebar`,
  keyed on `hasSplit` via `RowContent`), which persists while the split is hidden.
  The title-bar split button is a 4-state glyph: an outline when there is no split, a filled
  split-rectangle (`rectangle.split.2x1.fill`) while the split is shown side-by-side, and a half-filled
  glyph naming the visible pane once the split is collapsed to one pane
  (`rectangle.lefthalf.filled` = primary, `rectangle.righthalf.filled` = split pane, driven by `splitFocused`).
- `Close Session` is ⌘W (terminal-style).
  `AppActions.closeActiveSession()` first dismisses a focus-stealing cover in z-order — the frontmost
  window's quick terminal (`hide`), else the active session's open overlay (`closeOverlay`,
  full OR floating), else a shown scratch (`toggleScratch`) — and only closes the active session when
  no cover is up; it returns whether it handled the keystroke, and the File ▸ Close Session menu item
  falls back to `performClose` on the window ONLY when it returns false (no cover and no session,
  e.g. a window emptied to zero sessions).
  The cover guard lives in `closeActiveSession` rather than the menu on purpose:
  the menu's old `if activeSession != nil` gate skipped the guard when a window had no session but the
  quick terminal was up, closing the window instead of the cover.
  `AppStore.currentWorkspaceID`/`defaultWorkspaceName` are the host-free placement/naming helpers behind
  New Session / New Workspace.
- **Session navigation (between sessions).**
  Previous/Next Session sit on ⌥⌘↑/⌥⌘↓; First/Last Session have NO hotkey (menu + palette + `session.go`
  only).
  The keys deliberately AVOID the bare ⌘+arrow cluster: as always-enabled menu key-equivalents,
  bare ⌘←/→/↑/↓ shadow standard text-field caret nav (line/doc start/end) in the inline rename field,
  the palette search field, and Settings fields. ⌥⌘+arrows is not a text-field caret binding,
  so it doesn't shadow editing; ⌥⌘↑/↓ for sessions also complements the existing ⌥⌘←/→ "Focus Left/Right
  Pane" (left/right = panes, up/down = sessions), and first/last need no dedicated key.
  They are real menu items (the Navigate menu — see the menu-split note below),
  so AppKit menu dispatch swallows the shortcut before libghostty and nothing leaks to the shell.
  The pure logic is `AppStore.navigateSession(_:)` (host-free, unit-tested):
  it flattens the tree (`workspaces.flatMap(\.sessions)`), stops at the ends on next/prev (no wrap),
  jumps to the ends for first/last, falls to first on no/invalid selection,
  no-ops on an empty tree, and routes through `selectSession` (recency + badge + persist + workspace-derivation).
  It is shared by the menu, the action palette, and the control channel (`session.go`) so the three can't
  drift.
  Each GUI action (`AppActions.select{Next,Previous,First,Last}Session`) calls `focusActiveSession()`
  after the move so first responder follows into the moved-to terminal (the sidebar never steals focus);
  `WorkspaceSidebar.syncSelection()` expands the owning workspace if collapsed and `scrollRowToVisible`s
  the target so an off-screen row is revealed.
  Distinct from the ⌃Tab MRU switcher (recency order) and the ⌃P fuzzy palette (search) — this is predictable
  spatial stepping in the sidebar's visual order.
  **Attention navigation** (⌃⌥↑/⌃⌥↓ — the SAME arrow-fallback as the session nav,
  since arrows aren't keymap-expressible) is the variant that steps through ONLY the sessions needing
  attention (`AgentStatus.needsAttention` = `blocked`/`completed`), WRAPPING around and skipping idle/active.
  It reuses `AppStore.navigateSession` (the `.nextAttention`/`.previousAttention` cases — host-free,
  unit-tested) and is driven by Navigate ▸ Previous/Next Attention Session,
  the action palette, and `session.go next-attention|prev-attention`; the two new `BuiltinAction`s (`previous_attention_session`/`next_attention_session`)
  join the arrow-bound set (nil `defaultChord`, hardcoded ⌃⌥↑/↓ via `arrowShortcut`).
- `Delete Workspace` lives once in `AppActions.deleteWorkspace(_:)` (confirm alert when the workspace
  still has sessions, then `AppStore.removeWorkspace`) and is invoked from all three surfaces — the sidebar
  workspace row's context menu, the menu bar, and the action palette (the latter two via `deleteActiveWorkspace()`,
  which targets `currentWorkspaceID`).
  `AppStore.removeWorkspace` tears down each session's surfaces, prunes recency,
  and reselects; `canRemoveWorkspace` (count > 1) enforces keep-at-least-one and gates the menu item
  / palette entry.
  The sidebar Coordinator takes `AppActions` so the row menu routes through it rather than duplicating
  the confirm.
- The command palettes (`Palette.swift`: `PaletteController` + `CommandPalette`) feed off `AppActions.paletteActions()`/`paletteSessions()`
  and the host-free `fuzzyScore` (agtermCore, unit-tested).
  The visible list is a `@State` array recomputed on query/mode change — NOT a computed property — so
  the rendered rows and the Enter target can't drift out of sync; results sort by score then title. ⌃P
  opens the session switcher, ⌃⇧P the action palette (the session/action shortcut split is deliberate).
- **Built-in shortcut hints are one resolver, shared by the palette AND the toolbar/sidebar tooltips.**
  `AppActions.shortcutGlyph(for:)` (formerly `paletteHint`) → the host-free `Keymap.glyphHint(for:)`
  (`equivalent(for:)?.glyphString ?? BuiltinAction.arrowGlyphFallback`, nil = no shortcut) renders an
  action's CURRENT chord as macOS glyphs (`⌃⌘S`), tracking a `keymap.conf` rebind live.
  `paletteActions()` reads it for the right-aligned palette hint; `WindowContentView.helpHint(_:_:)`
  appends `" (<glyph>)"` to the `.help(…)` tooltip of the 8 `BuiltinAction`-backed toolbar/sidebar buttons
  (a button with no configured shortcut shows just its label). One resolver so the two surfaces can't
  drift — the display analogue of the `defaultChord`-single-source-of-truth rule. Tooltip text is pure
  visual chrome, so it is control-API keep-in-sync EXEMPT (no command, nothing to drive headless).
- **Attention list (the `.attention` palette mode).**
  A fourth `PaletteMode` (`.attention`, placeholder "Go to a session that needs attention…") lists the
  window's NON-IDLE sessions — broader than the ⌃⌥↑/↓ attention-NAV, which steps only `needsAttention`
  (blocked/completed).
  `AppActions.paletteAttention()` maps `AppStore.attentionSessions` (host-free,
  per-window: all non-idle, sorted blocked→active→completed then `statusChangedAt` newest-first,
  nil last) to `PaletteItem`s mirroring `paletteSessions()` (title=`displayName`,
  subtitle="workspace · detail"), with the new `PaletteItem.status: AgentStatus?` set so `CommandPalette.row`
  renders a leading `StatusGlyph` (the shared `AgentStatus.symbolName` + `GhosttyApp.statusColor(for:)`
  mapping the sidebar's `StatusIconView` also uses); `run` = `store.selectSession(id)`.
  Empty-query order is the `attentionSessions` order (the palette re-sorts by fuzzy score only once the
  user types); `.attention` needs no theme-preview wiring (`syncThemeSession` guards on `.themes`).
  Opened three keyboard/menu ways: `BuiltinAction.showAttention` (rawValue `show_attention`,
  `defaultChord` ⌃⇧I — a distinct chord swallowed before the terminal like ⌃⇧P/⌃⇧O,
  expressible/pure-`defaultChord`, NOT an arrow exception) → `AppActions.toggleAttentionPalette()` →
  `palette.toggle(.attention)`, the **Navigate ▸ "Go to Attention…"** menu item (reading `equivalent(for: .showAttention)`),
  and a **"Show Attention"** entry in `paletteActions()` (the ⌃⇧P launcher).
  The fourth opener is the title-bar bell (see the Notifications section).
  Opening a palette is interactive-only → keep-in-sync EXEMPT, like every other palette open.
  **Button-open focus fix (`CommandPalette.onAppear`):** a palette opened from a title-bar BUTTON (the
  bell) mounts while that button still holds first responder, so `onAppear`'s synchronous `fieldFocused = true`
  loses the race and the field never takes the keyboard; the fix re-asserts `fieldFocused = true` on
  the next runloop tick via `DispatchQueue.main.async` — a no-op for the already-focused menu/hotkey/⌃P
  opens (no competing responder).
- Inline rename has no direct handle from the menu/palette into the sidebar's editor,
  so `AppActions.renameActive{Session,Workspace}()` post `.agtermBeginRenameSession`/`.agtermBeginRenameWorkspace`;
  `WorkspaceSidebar.Coordinator` observes them and calls `beginEditing` on the selected row (async,
  so the row is on screen after any palette overlay closes).
  `AppActions.renamePending` keeps `focusActiveSession` (the palette/quick-terminal close focus-restore)
  off the rename field for ~0.6 s.
- The Ctrl-Tab session switcher (`SessionSwitcher` + `SessionSwitcherOverlay`) cycles a most-recently-used
  list.
  `AppStore.sessionRecency` (`RecencyStack<UUID>` in agtermCore — host-free,
  unit-tested) is pushed on every selection and pruned on close;
  the switcher snapshots it on `begin()` so cycling never reorders it (only the commit does,
  via `selectSession`).
  The order is persisted (`Snapshot.sessionRecency`, an optional field like the other post-v1 additions)
  and re-seeded on restore — stale ids dropped, the restored selection floated to the front — so the
  switcher works right after a relaunch instead of starting empty (#110).
  Persistence is pure model/restore behavior with no new user action,
  so it is control-API keep-in-sync EXEMPT.
  Keys come from app-wide `NSEvent` local monitors (`.keyDown` for Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab / Esc,
  `.flagsChanged` to detect the Ctrl release = commit), NOT SwiftUI shortcuts — the interaction needs
  Tab-while-Ctrl-held plus the modifier-release signal.
  The overlay has no focusable control, so the terminal keeps first responder and selection-on-commit
  re-focuses via `TerminalView`.
